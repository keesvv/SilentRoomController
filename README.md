# Command-line Examples

First off, you need to specify which lights you want to target. Letâ€™s say that
you have two lights connected to your bridge:

`[1] Living Room`

`[2] Bedroom`

If you want to target `[1]`, you could type:

`SilentRoomController.exe -id 1 -command <command> [command_args]`

You can also specify multiple lights as a target. For example, if you want both
lights `[1]` and `[2]` as a target. To do so, type the following:

`SilentRoomController.exe -id 1,2 -command <command> [command_args]`Â 

Here comes the command part. So now that you have specified which light(s) you
want as a target, you can choose a supported command. Commands are written
above. Letâ€™s say we now want lights `[1]` and `[2]` to turn on, type the
following:

`SilentRoomController.exe -id 1,2 -command 1`

The same goes for turning off both lights:

`SilentRoomController.exe -id 1,2 -command 2`

You might have noticed the `[command_args]` parameter. This is for the commands
which contains the â€˜(\*)â€™ symbol. This stands for: command parameter required.
This means that it needs another argument within the arguments. For example, the
`COMMAND_SET_BRIGHTNESS` command needs another argument, which specified the
brightness itself.

Letâ€™s say you want the light to be having brightness 100, you type the
following:

`SilentRoomController.exe -id 1 -command 4 100`

This is the end of the examples. If youâ€™d like to know more about using
